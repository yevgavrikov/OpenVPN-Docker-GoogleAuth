## Creating a VPN with 2 Factor Authentication using OpenVPN and Docker on EC2 instance

## How it works

This OpenVPN solution uses three separate open-source projects:

* [OpenVPN](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn) which provides the VPN functionality

* [OpenVPN-Admin](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/OpenVPN-Admin) which provides a UI for an administrator and users to set up VPN users.

* The [PHP gangsta — Google Authenticator project](https://github.com/PHPGangsta/GoogleAuthenticator) — a PHP implementation of the Google Authenticator reference app originally written for mobile.

The Community edition of OpenVPN does not provide 2 Factor authentication, therefore I had to add this feature.

So I forked the GitHub project [https://github.com/Chocobozzz/OpenVPN-Admin](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/OpenVPN-Admin) and added extra functionality required for enabling the Google Authenticator functionality.

The new OpenVPN implementation runs as 4 docker containers:

* **openvpn** docker container runs the openvpn server

* **webadmin** runs the webadmin interface for OpenVPN

* **googleauth** is a docker container that runs a small PHP microservice to do the 2 step authentication(pairing and validation).

Preparation:
 1. Install **Docker** - apt install docker.io
 2. Install **docker-compose** - apt install docker-compose

## How to setup (tested on aws ec2 ubuntu 20 instance):
    $cd /root
    $git clone [https://github.com/yevgavrikov/OpenVPN-Docker-GoogleAuth-EC2.git](https://github.com/yevgavrikov/OpenVPN-Docker-GoogleAuth-EC2.git) openvpn
    $cd openvpn
    $vim .env_template - "Change the parameters according your preferences
    $mv .env_template .env - "make environment variables persistent"
    $docker-compose up

    Creating network "openvpn-docker-googleauth_default" with the default driver
    Creating volume "openvpn-docker-googleauth_openvpn_config" with default driver
    Creating volume "openvpn-docker-googleauth_db_data" with default driver
    Building openvpn

Now check that you have 4 docker containers running in your system:

    $docker ps -a

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                        NAMES

The **googleauth** docker container is needed for the 2 factor authentication. It is called internally by openvpn and the webadmin when doing the 2 factor authentication.

The **db** docker container is used to store username/password.

The **OpenVPN** container runs the **OpenVPN** server to which the **OpenVPN** will connect.

The **webadmin** container contains the OpenVPN web administration interface where you can create **VPN** accounts and setup **2Factor** authentication.

Stop the docker compose and run in background
    $docker-compose stop 
    $ docker-compose up -d

To access the OpenVPN web administration interface you use instance public IP:

[http://<INSTANCE_IP>:8080/](http://<INSTANCE_IP>:8080/)

![OpenVPN Web Admin](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2430/1*WC1JKfOPNKG4vAsObzXcWg.png)

Before we can log in, we need to do the initial setup:

Go to the following URL:

[http://<INSTANCE_IP>:8080/index.php?installation](http://<INSTANCE_IP>:8080/index.php?installation)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2532/1*nQrPBCOEkd98HSJm5A0Aig.png)

Pick an admin username and a secure password.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*9NwA02Ozurt6_HceMDbapQ.png)

Now we should be able to login:

Let’s create a VPN user

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7J2oxmSdQAGol_gh0Z1rmQ.png)

The new user should be visible in the list below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3186/1*zItIIZZNx60VWX6wrl8euA.png)

Now that you have a VPN user, there are three steps required for setup of each VPN user.

 1. **Set up 2-Factor Authentication:** Each VPN user needs to download the Google Authenticator app and pair the app with their VPN account. Note that it is possible to switch off 2 Factor authentication via the admin UI.

 2. **Download OpenVPN zip file:** To be able to create a new profile, you need to download a ZIP file that contains the client certificate(.ovpn file) that you will need later when setting up the OpenVPN client.

 3. Setting up the OpenVPN client

### Setting up 2-Factor Authentication

 1. Navigate to the OpenVPN Web Administration Page, at [http://<INSTANCE_IP>:8080](http://<INSTANCE_IP>:8080)

 2. Click **Setup Google Authentication** on the navigation bar

 3. Enter the credentials given by your administrator to log in.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*sCNwY7V-bI3uSMnx4g72FQ.png)

4. After login you should see the following page:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2162/1*uY6zrRkyOjiwtvSDVCwwoA.png)

At this stage, you should install the Google Authenticator app on your mobile phone.

Open your **Google Authenticator App**, and press the ‘**+**’ icon in the top right and then press ‘Scan Barcode’

Point your camera at the QR code and you should see the profile appear with your details.

5. Next you need to type the 6 digit PIN number you see in the Authenticator app. If it all goes well, the pairing will succeed and you will see a “Pairing succeeded” message. If you see an error instead, it is possible that you were too slow typing the PIN number. Try again.

**Download OpenVPN zip file**

 1. Navigate to the OpenVPN Web Administration Page, at [http://<INSTANCE_IP>:8080](http://<INSTANCE_IP>:8080)

 2. Click **Configurations** on the navigation bar

 3. Enter the VPN user credentials given by your administrator to log in.

 4. Choose the correct OS from the dropdown: Linux, OS X(MacOS) or Windows

 5. Click “**Get Configuration Files**”. You will be downloading a ZIP file with the required client configuration for OpenVPN. Keep it in a safe folder. You will need it soon.

## Setting up the OpenVPN Client

I am assuming at this stage that you have already completed the steps above and your VPN is accessible via a public IP address on a given port. The VPN IP address will be stored in the client certificates that we downloaded earlier.

Download the OpenVPN client for your operating system. Ensure that you download version 3 or above. Version 2 will not work.

**MacOS Download:** [https://openvpn.net/downloads/openvpn-connect-v3-macos.dmg](https://openvpn.net/downloads/openvpn-connect-v3-macos.dmg)

**Windows Download:** [https://openvpn.net/downloads/openvpn-connect-v3-windows.msi](https://openvpn.net/downloads/openvpn-connect-v3-windows.msi)

Install the OpenVPN client.

### Install the client Certificate

After installing the OpenVPN client, you should see the following screen:

![Initial screen without any VPN profiles](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wB2bB5zKo-OwRECJkUM5AQ.jpeg)

Click the + sign, and select file.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HF5zSJMY6hy147uHFManxg.png)

Select the client.ovpn file you downloaded in the earlier step(don’t forget to unzip).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*AfxGMKdShLwzXANXVHiRCQ.jpeg)

At this stage, you need to supply your VPN credentials. Click **Save Password**. But remember that every time you log in, if you don’t disable 2 Factor Authentication you will need to add your 6 digits **PIN** number to the end of your password. This is slightly annoying, but worth it because of the extra security.

Click **Save** when you are done.

And that’s it, you now have a VPN profile setup ready to connect.

### Connecting to the VPN using 2 Factor Authentication

Every time you try to connect to the VPN you will need to supply a six-digit PIN that is everchanging. This PIN is available from the google authenticator app.

 1. Just before you login take note of the latest PIN number(you need to be quick)

 2. Click the toggle button on the left-hand side to connect to the VPN

3. At this stage you will be prompted for your password.

Enter your password and add at the end of your password without any extra spaces the PIN number from step 1. Click OK

4. You will see a Connection Error message. Click “Continue”

5. If all goes well, you are connected to the VPN!

And a new world opens up!
Hope you enjoy it.
